        <p>
            Rylan Miller is a mechanical engineer out of Colorado. Driven by a joy in seeing their labor manifest in 
            something tangible, mostly as it can be experienced by others. They have an interest in product development, 
            especially early product design and rapid prototyping. As well as any form of emerging or rapidly advancing 
            technology, such as additive manufacturing, robotics, or machine learning (github copilot truly is amazing). <br>
            <br>
            In their personal time, Rylan enjoys being outdoors, skiing, slacklining, rafting, and camping. They also enjoy 
            making things in any form, be it a piece of camping gear, some furniture, or a card game python simulation. Anything 
            that can give a new insight on how society or the world around them works. There is always something that is new and interesting 
            around (floating point numbers and the FISR algorithm?), being open to discovery at any point is always the key. <br>
